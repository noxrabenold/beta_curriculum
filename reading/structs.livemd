## Setup

Ensure you run the `ea` command to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively,
you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:kino, github: "livebook-dev/kino", override: true},
  {:kino_lab, "~> 0.1.0-dev", github: "jonatanklosko/kino_lab"},
  {:vega_lite, "~> 0.1.3"},
  {:benchee, "~> 0.1"},
  {:ecto, "~> 3.7"},
  {:math, "~> 0.7.0"},
  {:utils, path: "utils"}
])
```

## Structs

We've learned how to abstract behavior in our programs, but what about data?

It's often useful to be able to create a custom data structure. That's what structs are for.
**Struct** is simply a short word for structure. They are an extension on top of maps that enforce
constraints on your data.

### Defining a Struct

Let's say you're building a family tree but this time, you want to make sure that every
`Person` has a name. You could define a struct with the :name key

```elixir
defmodule Person do
  defstruct [:name]
end
```

You'll notice that structs are defined using modules! the only new concept here is the `defstruct` construct.

`defstruct` is an Elixir keyword that means "this module is a struct". You then define a list of keys for the struct
that will always exist on the struct.

### Using a Struct

A struct is essentially a custom data structure that we've defined. You create instances
using `%STRUCT{}` syntax that looks very similar to how you create a map.

```elixir
%Person{}
```

You'll notice that the struct has a name key, but no value since we didn't provide anything.

Here's how you can pass in a name.

```elixir
%Person{name: "Peter Parker"}
```

So, why not just use a map? We could easily define a similar map and it looks exactly the same.

```elixir
%{name: "Peter Parker"}
```

There are a ton of reasons to use a struct vs a map. It's not possible in this section to cover
all of them.

One main reason, is to validate our data and ensure keys and values exist with the expected data.

For example, using a struct guarantees that certain keys exist, even if the value is `nil`. So it's
always safe to use `.` syntax. Notice how `map.name` results in an error, but `struct.name` simply returns nil.

```elixir
map = %{}
map.name
```

```elixir
struct = %Person{}
struct.name
```

We also guarantee that other keys don't exist. For example, if we don't define `age` on our person struct,
it can't be set. This helps ensure we use the data structure as intended.

```elixir
defmodule Person do
  defstruct [:name]
end

%Person{age: 20}
```

We also get some very handy features such as default values using a keyword list.

```elixir
defmodule Person do
  defstruct name: "Peter Parker"
end

%Person{}
```

It's common to validate data in a struct. For example, you can use the `@enforce_keys`
module attribute to enforce that certain keys are set, other wise the struct will throw an error
`the following keys must also be given when building struct Person: [:name]`.

```elixir
defmodule Person do
  @enforce_keys [:name]
  defstruct [:name]
end

%Person{}
```

Right now, we can create a Person struct who has a name of 25. That doesn't really make much sense.

```elixir
defmodule Person do
  defstruct [:name]
end

%Person{name: 25}
```

So you can imagine it's useful to validate the data in a struct upon creation.
It's a common pattern to create a `new` function in the struct that handles creation and validation.

Here's how we could use the `is_bitstring/1` guard from earlier to ensure that name is only ever a string.
You'll notice we return a tuple with `:ok` and the struct. This is part of a common pattern to
communicate with code that the `Person` was created successfully.

Now, our code will give us an error if we misuse the `Person` struct! Excellent.

```elixir
defmodule Person do
  defstruct [:name]

  def new(name) when is_bitstring(name) do
    {:ok, %Person{name: name}}
  end
end

Person.new(25)
```

### Functions a Struct module.

A module that defines a `struct` is still a regular module as well.

You can define functions as usual.

```elixir

```

### Your Turn

* Define a new struct `Hero`.

* A `Hero` will have a `:name`, `:catchphrase`, and `secret_identity`

* create a `reveal/1` function which takes in an instance of a hero and returns

  `"I am secretly #{hero.secret_identity}"`

* create an `introduce/2` function which takes in an instance of a hero and a greeting
  and returns

  `"#{greeting} I am #{hero.name}"`

```elixir
defmodule Hero do
  defstruct [:name, :catchphrase, :secret_identity]
end

venom = %Hero{name: "Venom", catchphrase: "Lethal Protector", secret_identity: "Eddie Brock"}

reveal = fn x ->
  "I am secretly #{x.secret_identity}!"
end

introduce = fn x, greeting ->
  "#{greeting} I am #{x.name}"
end

introduce.(venom, "Hello")
```

```elixir
%Hero{}
```

### Your Turn

In the Elixir below, create an instance of a Hero with the following data and bind it
to the variable `spider_man`.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Hero {
    name: Spider Man
    catchphrase: Friendly neighborhood Spiderman!
    secret_identity: Peter Parker
  }
```

```elixir
spider_man = %Hero{
  name: "Spider-Man",
  catchphrase: "Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man!",
  secret_identity: "Peter Parker"
}
```

Use the `Hero.introduce/2` function on `spider_man`.

```elixir
introduce.(spider_man, "Hello")
```

Use the `Hero.reveal/1` function on `spider_man`.

```elixir
reveal.(spider_man)
```

### Updating a Struct

Structs are an extension of maps under the hood, so you can use the same map update syntax.

```elixir
defmodule MyUpdatableStruct do
  defstruct [:key]
end
```

```elixir
initial = %MyUpdatableStruct{key: "value"}
updated = %{initial | key: "new value"}
```
